# robertson-target-practice

A very basic web-app used to control a raspberry pi.

We connected the raspberry pi to a relay switch.

The switch is connected to a solenoid which powers a pneumatic arm connected to a rotating target.

TODO:
Test the timing of each stage.
Flesh out the web app.
Add bluetooth comms.
Configure the app to be a PWA.
